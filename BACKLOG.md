# Keep the Light: feature backlog

The working list of feature ideas. Claude reads it before every build and builds what is under "Requested for the
next build". Shipped features move to "Done" with their version number. Nothing is built until the owner says
"build".

## Requested for the next build

- **Double episodes (one file, two TMDB episodes) and the numbering after them.** Example: Laverne & Shirley (1976)
  S05: TMDB has "We're in the Army, Now" as episodes 9 and 10; the file is one, named S05E09, so every later file is
  looked up as the episode before it.
  - Names like `S05E09-E10`, `S05E09E10`, `S05E09-10` are read as both episodes: title "… (Parts 1 & 2)", the first
    part's date, both descriptions, Plex name `Show (Year).S05E09-E10.Title.<details>`.
  - Plex names tab: a file can be marked **double episode** (or **first half of a split episode**, the reverse
    case); the later files of that season are looked up one number on (or back). Each row shows what it is on TMDB.
  - Keep the Light suggests it by itself: a file at least 1.6× the season's usual length whose TMDB episode and the
    next share a title, or together match its length ("S05E09 looks like TMDB episodes 9 and 10… Yes / No").
  - Renaming the season is one batch (undoable); a name that another file in the batch is leaving is not a clash,
    and files are renamed in an order that never overwrites (temporary names for a loop).
  - Queue files follow (their lookups are redone with the new numbers).
- **Target file size follows double episodes.** With **Target file size**, a file that is two episodes (named
  `S05E09-E10`, or marked as a double on the Plex names tab) gets twice the target (three episodes: three times),
  and the plan line says so. The half of a split episode gets half.

## Ideas raised, not yet requested

None at the moment.

## Done

- 1.34.0: your own subtitle files (added as tracks, found by name, encoding fixed, timing offset); VobSub to SRT; the file's bitrate always shown with a target comparison.
- 1.33.2: pop-ups always kept inside the window; right-click menu placed correctly at any text size.
- 1.33.1: fixed the full-GPU path failing on full-range files (skips them, checks with the job's colour options, retries the normal way on failure).
- 1.33.0: uses the whole window (two-column Convert tab when wide, full-width lists), Text size setting with Ctrl +/−/0, window remembers its size and place.
- 1.32.0: Plex names tab (a file renamer for the queue and added folders: Rename now with subtitle files, Undo last rename, Rename log, Use for the converted files; folders never renamed).
- 1.31.0: track names in English instead of the language's own script, more language names (yue, cmn and others); track names follow through a series in the queue; new README "New since version 1.27" section.
- 1.30.0: Plex-style names in the dotted format with resolution, HEVC and HDR kind (Plex matching to be confirmed by the owner on real files).
- 1.29.0: already-converted tag; Plex refresh; schedule and watch folder; failure logs.
- 1.28.0: optional Plex-style names with Review names; fill in track details from names; TMDB logo; no work folders kept when nothing was finished; a second try for unreadable Dolby Vision data.
- 1.27.0: TMDB "Which one?" window; crop black bars (576p and 480p only).
- 1.26.0: Pause / Resume; Stop after this file; move a queued file to the top or bottom.
- 1.25.1: fixed the 30-second test of MP4 files with text subtitles.
- 1.25.0: TMDB: match one file by hand, the rest of that title follows (remembered; Settings can forget).
- 1.24.1: the queue hint no longer flickers (UI-7); Start no longer also adds (UI-4); UI-12 tighter spacing. To undo
  UI-4 or UI-7, revert both commits with that number.
- 1.24.0: deinterlace (automatic, from the picture); queue estimates for short files; Browse remembers the last
  folder; layout and UI changes UI-1 to UI-11, each its own commit so any one can be reverted alone (`git revert`
  the commit titled "UI-n: …", then a patch release).
- 1.23.0: Plex check when files are added (settings-aware, a summary on the Queue tab, and a check of each finished
  file); 576p and 480p resolutions.
- 1.22.0: empty subtitle/audio tracks left out automatically; Skip Plex extras in the library scan; right-click
  Cut/Copy/Paste/Select all; queued file logs scroll again, with a Copy log button.
- 1.21.0: batch and per-file progress on the Queue tab (time left for the batch and the running file, estimates for
  waiting files, time taken for finished ones).
- 1.20.1: releases built on GitHub with the current Go; `govulncheck` passes.
- 1.20.0:
  - **Queue:** Clear the queue; back to the Queue tab after Edit; "Same tracks for others".
  - **Track rules:** one audio track per language; subtitles kept or dropped by name.
  - **Track naming:** untitled tracks named from what they are.
  - **TMDB:** lookup for the queue and the library scan; a language setting; the key in Credential Manager.
  - **Profiles:** `-profile` on the command line; MKV/MP4 saved in profiles.
  - **Other:** Tesseract language hint; SHA-256 checksums; govulncheck on GitHub.
- 1.19.x: ASS and PGS subtitles to SRT (PGS by Tesseract OCR); clearer Tesseract warnings; retry when another
  program has a file open.
- 1.18.x: new layout (tabs, Start bar always visible, ⚙ Settings).
- 1.17.0: metadata lookup on TMDB.
- 1.16.0: library scan, compatible audio track rule, work locally.
- 1.15.0: full-GPU path for NVENC and QuickSync, space saved.
- Earlier versions are in `CHANGELOG.md`.
